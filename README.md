# Red Rover Code Puzzle 2: Deal a hand

Use Object Oriented principles to create an application that represents a game of cards, including the deck of cards, players, and their hands and can print the current state of each player's hand when requested.

The card deck should be a standard 52 card deck.

The program should:
- Prompt for a number of players and the number of cards in a hand.
- Shuffle the deck
- Deal the hands to the players
- Allow the user to request to see the contents of 1 player's hand or all players' hands (Note: a GUI is not required.  Each card can be represented by a string stating the suit and number of the card.)
